==========

*Quickstrom* is a new autonomous testing tool for the web. It can find
problems in any type of web application that renders to the DOM. Quickstrom
automatically explores your application and presents minimal failing
examples. Focus your effort on understanding and specifying your system,
and Quickstrom can test it for you.
